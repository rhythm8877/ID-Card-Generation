# ID Card Generator with Firebase Integration

This application allows users to generate ID cards and stores the data in Firebase.

## Firebase Setup Instructions

To use the Firebase integration, you need to set up a Firebase project and update the configuration:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Click "Add project" and follow the setup steps
   - Enable Google Analytics if desired

2. **Register Your Web App**:
   - In your Firebase project, click on the Web icon (</>) to add a web app
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "ID Card Generator")
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object

3. **Update Firebase Configuration**:
   - Open the `firebase-config.js` file in this project
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
     };
     ```

4. **Set Up Firestore Database**:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database"
   - Click "Create database"
   - Start in production mode or test mode as needed
   - Choose a location closest to your users

5. **Set Up Storage Rules**:
   - In the Firebase Console, go to "Storage"
   - Click "Get started"
   - Set up rules for file storage
   - Default rules allow authenticated reads and writes:
     ```
     rules_version = '2';
     service firebase.storage {
       match /b/{bucket}/o {
         match /{allPaths=**} {
           allow read, write;
         }
       }
     }
     ```

6. **Deploy Your Application**:
   - Upload your files to a web server or hosting service
   - You can also use Firebase Hosting for easy deployment
